#Recommended Rails Reading

##Rails Guides
As you delve deeper into Rails, familiarize yourself with each of the following essential Rails Guides. **Tonight**, spend 90 minutes reading through 2 guides on topics you haven't read about yet or that you feel less familiar with. 

Be aware that Ruby on Rails changes often, and there are different editions of these guides for each version. Make sure you are using the current "stable" guides, not the "edge" guides.

##Bonus: Other Useful Tools

Here are some other frequently-used Rails tools you might want to read about!  


####FFaker

We've touched on using Ffaker to generate test data, but take a look at the [docs](https://github.com/EmmanuelOga/ffaker)!

####Factory Girl

[Factory Girl](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl_rails) abstracts away the process of creating new instances of a Model. It works great with Ffaker for seeding your database. For more information checkout the getting started [guide](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/factory_girl/2.3.2/file/GETTING_STARTED.md).



####Simple Form

If you're feeling good about basic Rails forms, [Simple Form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form) gives you another way to do it. 

####Sass

Syntactically awesome style sheets, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide), makes writting CSS easier & more fun! Rails comes bundled with it by default, so even better.
