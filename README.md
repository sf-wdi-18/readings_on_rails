#Recommended Rails Reading

##Rails Guides
As you delve deeper into Rails, familiarize yourself with each of the following essential Rails Guides. **Tonight**, spend 90 minutes reading through 2 guides on topics you haven't read about yet or that you feel less familiar with. 

Be aware that Ruby on Rails changes often, and there are different editions of these guides for each version. Make sure you are using the current "stable" guides, not the "edge" guides.

[Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)
